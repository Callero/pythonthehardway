## Keywords

Keyword   | Answer
:----------         | :----------
`and`   | logic test, checks is objects are the same
`del`   | deletes and object or part of an object
`from`   | Tells which module to import a function from
`not`   | Inverses a logic test. i.e. `not True == False`
`while`   | Initializes a while loop that will run as long as the statement is true
`as`   | Sets an imported module alias
`elif`   | Further logic tests after an `if` test
`global`   | a global variable that exists outside individual functions 
`or`   | logic test, checks if one of the objects are `True`
`with`   | Used when working with a resource, like a file. Ensures that files for instance are closed when done.
`assert`   | Used as a unit test for functions. Asserts that certain conditions are true. <br>For instance `assert type(variable) is IntType`
`else`   | Final logic test in a after any `elif` always after `if`
`if`   | Logic test
`pass`   | A `null` operation, nothing happens.<br>Used as a filler or stub for other functionality
`yield`   | Studied [here][1]. Used in `generators` to "save the work" of a function. <br>Returns a series of values before "handing back control" to the caller
`break`   | Terminates a current loop and continues to the next statement
`except`   | Handles exceptions and lets the programmer define what to return.
`import`   | imports a module
`print`   | prints to the terminal
`class`   | Studied [here][2]. Like `def` defines a function, <br>`class` defines a logical grouping of functions and data.
 `exec`   | executes a statement or program but returns nothing
 `in`   | checks for a value in a range of values
 `raise`   | Used for raising errors in the code, causes an `except`ion to be raised, signaling an error situation
 `continue`   | continues processing a loop, <br>like `break` stops it and `pass` does nothing
 `finally`   | Used with `try`:`except`:`finally`.<br>Used to provide code that will always execute, even though an exception was raised
 `is`   | compares identity of two objects, like `==` compares values
 `return`   | Defines what to return to the caller from a function <br>and also returns the control to the caller
 `def`   | Initializes a function, used with `def function_name(parameters):`
 `for`   | Used to create a for-loop that iterates over the items in a collection
 `lambda`   | Creates an *anonymous function*, <br>always returns the value of the statement inside
 `try`   | Lets the user create a program that can handle exceptions: `try`->`except`
